# math-exploration
This project is a little different from most in that that point is not any sort of application, and none of the main code entry points are intended to be particularly useful as anything but an example. 

The intent of this code is probably closest to that of a library, but it is not intended for consumption. Instead, this is a place where I explore various mathematical interests. I am sharing this code here with the intent that I might document some of my exploration, and share some of the insights I have gained.

See other markdown files in this folder for details on what I have learned.
